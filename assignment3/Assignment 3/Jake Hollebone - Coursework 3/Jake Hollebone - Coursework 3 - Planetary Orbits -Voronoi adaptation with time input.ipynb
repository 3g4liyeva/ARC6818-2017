    "*This coursework example I aimed to reuse one of the previous scripts in which I had developed which was the attempt of the Voronoi pattern. The aim of which was to randomly scatter points within a specified boundary and then arrange the points so that they were positioned around their nearest node/point. For this weeks coursework I chose to build from this code and implement time as an input for the problem. The way in which I did this can be seen below, but in summary I called upon the current time feature within python to gain live data of the time and then use this as three different inputs within my code, as hours, minutes and seconds. The way that these inputs were then used was to give three different turtles/groups of points a different set of movements relative to whether they were assigend to be an hour, minute or second marker. The graphic/animation that this code gives can be shown below, however on first glace it can be seen that the animation gives an almost planetary orbit visual (which served as the focus when creating this amended code), with three different clusters being arranged around a central point/node and then moving in a radial movement in relation to the time input much like an orbit time for a planet. *"

    "*As shown in the images above, the script constructs three distinct radial patterns based off central points/nodes which act as markers for hours, days and seconds. Then as the script I created within coursework 2 shows the 3 different coloured points are then randomly placed onto the screen. Then these points are each assigned a movement in relation to the input of time, with black points being centred around the current hour, blue around the current minute and then red around the current seconds, then these then move/update as time continues. However there is a slight issue within the code, where as the minute points update it then causes a pause of around 1 second for the updating of the seconds points, I have tried several iterations to correct this point but have been unsucsessful. However even with this slight issue the graphics accurately show the movement of the points in relation to time (hours, minutes and seconds). The reason I decided to created this graphic was to recreate the movement/orbit of planets reative to eachother all of which have different orbit times/periods; being that of a minute (red planet), an hour (blue planet) and 12 hours (black planet); with potential to add additional orbits with the time input of days, months and years, however this was not simulated within this example as it would have to be run for a long time to give the desired animation.*"
